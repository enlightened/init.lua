# Neovim Dotfiles

These are my nvim configuration files. Built off of ThePrimeagen's [init.lua](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua), I plan on adding more customizations to better fit my needs.

Only requirement is that [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) is installed beforehand.
